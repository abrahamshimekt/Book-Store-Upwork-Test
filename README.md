# Book-Store-Upwork-Test
Objective: Build a RESTful API for a simple bookstore management system using Node.js. The API will handle book inventory operations including creating, reading, updating, and deleting book entries (CRUD).



Task Details:
1. API Requirements:



Create: Allow users to add new books to the system with details such as title, author, ISBN, and stock quantity.
Read: Retrieve book details by ISBN and list all books with pagination support.
Update: Update the details of an existing book, including increasing or decreasing stock levels.
Delete: Remove a book from the system using its ISBN.
2. Technical Specifications:



Framework: Use Express.js to build the API.
Database: Integrate MongoDB using Mongoose for data modeling.
Validation: Ensure that all inputs are validated before processing.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage and return appropriate status codes and messages.
3. Code Quality and Best Practices:



Modular Structure: Organize the code into modules based on functionality (e.g., routes, controllers, models, services).
Commenting and Documentation: Include clear comments and documentation using tools like JSDoc.
Testing: Write tests using Jest or Mocha to cover unit and integration tests.
Linter: Configure and use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style.
Version Control: Use Git for version control with clear commit messages and proper branching for features, fixes, and releases.
4. Performance Considerations:



Optimization: Implement techniques to optimize API performance, such as proper indexing in MongoDB and query optimization.
Caching: Introduce caching mechanisms where appropriate to reduce database load.
5. Security Measures:



Secure the API: Implement security best practices such as input sanitization, using HTTPS, and securing headers.
Authentication: Add JWT-based authentication to protect routes that modify the bookstore inventory.
